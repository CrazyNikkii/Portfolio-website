          <p>
            Hey there! I'm a 25-year-old ICT student at Metropolia AMK, and a proud nerd through and through. I have a deep love for technology, gaming, and all things geeky. When I’m not coding or gaming, you’ll find me enjoying a good cup of coffee and researching something odd.
            As a proud dad, I've mastered the fine art of dad jokes, so you can expect some <i>pun-derful</i> humor along the way. Whether it’s talking about the latest gadgets, debating the best sci-fi universes, or just enjoying a great game, I’m always up for a good conversation.
            Let’s chat over coffee!
          </p>

        <div class="job job-1">
          <h3 class="meticulous">Meticulous</h3>
          <h6><i>Perfection is in the details</i></h6>
          <p>
            I always put 110% into my work and hate leaving loose ends. Details matter to me, whether it's coding, problem-solving, or tackling a new challenge. I believe that quality comes from precision, and I take the time to ensure every piece fits perfectly. From the smallest details to the bigger picture, I strive for excellence in everything I do. Whether it's refining a project, debugging code, or simply organizing my workflow, I make sure nothing is left unfinished. If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="job job-2">
          <h3  class="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>
          <h6><i>If knowledge is power, then curiosity is the muscle</i></h6>
          <p>
            I am an endlessly curious person and i love to learn. My mind is always hungry for new knowledge, whether it's technology, science, history, or the most random topics imaginable. One moment, I might be studying the latest advancements in AI, and the next, I’m deep into a 3 AM rabbit hole about how nuclear power plant cooling systems work.
            I don’t just accept the world as it is; I want to understand <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> things work. If something sparks my interest, I dive headfirst into research, connecting the dots and expanding my understanding.
            If you ask me something I don’t know yet, I’m probably already researching it.
          </p>

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h3 class="people-driven">People-Driven</h3>
          <h6><i>Socializing fuels creativity and builds success</i></h6>
          <p>
            I’m an extrovert at heart. I thrive on connections, conversations, and shared experiences. Whether it’s brainstorming ideas, working on a project, or just sharing a good laugh, I believe the best things in life are done together.
            I love humor and use it to break the ice, build bonds, and make even the most ordinary moments more enjoyable. Meeting new people, exchanging ideas, and learning from different perspectives energize me. I’m the kind of person who sparks up conversations with strangers and turns teammates into friends.
            For me, success isn’t just about individual achievements. It’s about growing, laughing, and creating with others.
